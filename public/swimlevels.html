            As your swimmer progresses, our lessons have a class that will continue to push the student. An equal emphasis is placed
            on technique as well as endurance. One week prior to registration for the upcoming session your instructor will
            give a progress report recommending the next sessions' placement. Below is an outline of the skills covered
            for each level. For initial placement to classes please contact us for a 5 minute swim evalation.

                  movement, confidence in jumping then returning to the wall, and learning how to be safe by the pool.

              <p>Leap frog is the perfect class for children who are hesitant to separate from their parent. The first week
                will be a parent child class allowing the child time to get used to the new environment of the pool with
                the familiarity of the parent. Week 2 we begin to have the child separate from the parent to the instructor.
                Week 3-6 we will begin to have the parent leave the pool, then leave the pool deck so that the child is ready
                for their independent class without the parent.
