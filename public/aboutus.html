        <h3 class="text-center">Why our methods are effective</h3>
        <p class="text-center">

          Learning to swim is a process that depends on the mastery of a progression of skills. We crafted our swim class curriculum
          to help swimmers of all ages and skill levels master the five developmental components of swimming: comfort, coordination,
          technique, endurance and speed. We offer swim classes in a variety of formats, including group classes, parent-infant
          classes and one-on-one private lessons. Our swim instruction classes begin as early as four months old and go all
          the way to adults.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tecn">
        <h5>
          <strong>Comfort: </strong> when the body is relaxed you absorb the material better and remain more buoyant in the water.
          <h5>
            <strong>Coordination: </strong>being able to know exactly where you want your body position to land in the water is crucial
            in stroke development.</h5>
          <h5>
            <strong>Technique: </strong>Once the foundation is set, technique will add speed and efficiency.</h5>
          <h5>
            <strong>Endurance: </strong>Work to have lap 1 look as great as lap 100. As swimmers become tired, form suffers. Endurance
            prepares you to get past this.</h5>
          <h5>
            <strong>Speed: </strong>Once form is learned, we work on quickening the motions for speed.</h5>
